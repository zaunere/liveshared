### LiveShared lets you share your VS Code workspace with others in real-time, enabling collaborative coding sessions and "JIT" gatherings.

### It allows multiple users to edit files simultaneously, see each other's cursors, and communicate through an integrated chat feature.

### Maybe you know them, may you don't, but LiveShared is a great way to share your VS Code workspace with others in real-time - demonstrate techniques, AND MAKE NEW FRIENDS!

### Users can also *live prompt* for spectators to watch and participate.
